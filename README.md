# Recomandation-System-Gan
a deep Gan collaborative recommandation system to enhance user exploration of new item. The goal here is to train a model to not only judge wich recommandation is a good one based on the user but also to learn wich new item could fit in to let the user explore new content with no need of random variable.

## how to make it work

You need to first train a model and download it with the script deep learning recommandation system wih timestamp and so then you can run the demo with the trained model.
You also need to put the file data item in the root folder of each script.

## to learn more about all that their will be a link to my memoire wich is in fench and so to a lot of science paper down their.
